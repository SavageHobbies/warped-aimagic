# CSV Import Testing Guide

## ðŸ”§ Enhanced CSV Import Is Ready!

Your enhanced CSV import system is now active and ready to handle your CPI format files.

## âœ… What's Been Fixed:

1. **Search Field Spacing**: Magnifying glass no longer overlaps text (pl-12 instead of pl-10)
2. **CPI Format Support**: Specialized parser for your exact CSV structure
3. **Image Processing**: Handles comma-separated image URLs from CPI format
4. **Better Error Handling**: Skips empty rows and personal data

## ðŸ§ª How to Test:

### Method 1: Web Browser (Easiest)
1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Go to "Add Product" page
3. Click "Bulk Import" tab
4. Select your file: "current funko 8-8-25 - CPI.csv"
5. Click "Process File"

### Method 2: Test with Small File First
1. Use the test file: "test-cpi-import.csv" (2 products)
2. This will test the functionality without processing 920 rows
3. Check the results in the inventory page

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results:

**From your full CPI file (920 rows):**
- ~920 Funko Pop products imported
- Multiple images per product (from Images field + Image 1-12 fields)
- Proper pricing (Price, Lowest/Highest Recorded Price)
- Complete product details (UPC, Brand, Model, Description)
- Empty rows skipped gracefully

**Success Indicators:**
- âœ… Products appear in inventory with images
- âœ… UPC codes are properly assigned
- âœ… Brands show as "Funko"
- âœ… Prices are correctly mapped
- âœ… Multiple images per product

## ðŸš¨ If You See Issues:

1. Check browser console (F12) for any errors
2. Try the small test file first
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
4. Make sure you're using http://localhost:3000

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status:

âœ… Search field icon spacing - FIXED
âœ… CPI CSV format parser - ENHANCED  
âœ… Image processing - IMPROVED
âœ… Server running on port 3000 - ACTIVE

Your system is ready to handle the complex CPI format properly now!
