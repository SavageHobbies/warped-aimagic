## üîë Key Decisions Made

1. **Unified Export Endpoint**
   - Chose single endpoint over multiple format-specific endpoints
   - Simplifies maintenance and testing
   - Allows for easier addition of new formats

2. **CSV Security by Default**
   - All exports include CSV injection protection
   - No opt-out to ensure security
   - Minimal performance impact

3. **Excel Compatibility Mode**
   - UTF-8 BOM added by default for better Excel support
   - Configurable delimiter for regional differences
   - CRLF line endings for Windows compatibility

4. **50,000 Row Export Limit**
   - Prevents server timeout and memory issues
   - Sufficient for most use cases
   - Can be adjusted via configuration

5. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Created comprehensive test suite before deployment
   - Includes unit, integration, and manual tests
   - Ensures reliability and maintainability

## üí≠ Reflections & Recommendations

### What Went Well
- Clean separation of concerns (API, UI, Tests)
- Comprehensive documentation from the start
- Security-first approach to CSV generation
- Modular design allows easy format addition

### Areas for Improvement
- Consider streaming for very large exports
- Add WebSocket for real-time progress
- Implement job queue for background processing
- Add more granular error handling

### Technical Recommendations
1. **Performance**: Implement Redis caching for frequent exports
2. **Scalability**: Use job queue (Bull/BullMQ) for large exports
3. **Monitoring**: Add APM tool (New Relic/DataDog)
4. **Security**: Implement rate limiting immediately
5. **UX**: Add progress bars for long operations

### Business Recommendations
1. **User Feedback**: Test with actual users before full rollout
2. **Training**: Create video tutorials for export features
3. **Analytics**: Track which formats are most used
4. **Iteration**: Plan for adding more export formats
5. **Support**: Prepare FAQ for common export issues
